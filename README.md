Remember back in the days of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch players didn't have the default footsteps? There were rebel, combine and metropolice footsteps depending on your model. Now you can enjoy those footsteps back in Garry's Mod with this addon (or if you simply want the footsteps because you think it's cool)!

The addon allows the player to pick which footsteps should be used while walking around. There are 4 different footsteps to choose from: Default, Rebel, Combine and MetroPolice.

Here are some client ConVars:
cl_player_footsteps
cl_player_footsteps_combination

!! This addon does not override footstep sounds from the "sound" directory! It overrides the footsteps by hooking on to PlayerFootstep. !!

This is an addon created by pure boredom, it's simple and useless but it can be used if you prefer using a certain footstep for a model you have. The coding is also bigger than expected due to EmitSound not precaching and playing from sound scripts properly.

This is the description from the Steam Workshop page.
